Nice template, GitHub!

Anyways!

Hi and welcome to my profile. Feel free to take a look at my unfinished and unbegun projects. I am still learning, but I've been picking up new knowledge almost every day and trying out new stuff since 2020. I'm always down for a new challenge.

- 🌍 The languages I speak: C and Python
