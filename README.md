- 👋 Hi, I’m @zhengliw
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and.... non-sense stuff...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python...?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing (sorry GitHub I will report bugs to software I like, though).
- 📫 How to reach me: DON'T! I'm not old enough to meet random people on the internet.
