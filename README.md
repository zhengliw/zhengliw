Welcome to my profile, feel free to look around!

Not currently doing much on GitHub, except for occasionally reporting bugs and
working on some smaller personal projects... That are mostly either unbegun or
unfinished. Or both actually :P

*Stuff I've messed with...*

I'm not that of an expert on most of the things listed here, but I've got a
general idea how to use these things. I've probably touched on a lot more

updated...

    - Python
    - C 
    - HTML 
    - CSS

        - REST APIs
    - Relational databases

          no idea :(

One thing I found myself spending a lot of time on is self-hosting... You can do
so much!

Keep climbing. Happy coding!
