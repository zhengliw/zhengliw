# Create, share, collaborate.

Welcome to my profile, feel free to look around!

Not currently doing much on GitHub, except for occasionally reporting bugs and
working on some smaller personal projects... That are mostly either unbegun or
unfinished. Or both actually :P

I'm currently running Win 11 and Fedora Workstation in a dual boot setup on my
desktop PC, and Fedora Server on my home server. I've used VSCode, but I'm
currently learning Vim to switch to a keyboard and command line driven
workflow, or precisely Neovim... Because keyboard navigation go clicky-clacky
makes me very happy :)

I'm not that of an expert on most of the things listed here, but I've got a
