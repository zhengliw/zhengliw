Nice template, GitHub!

Anyways!

Hi and welcome to my profile. Feel free to take a look at my unfinished and unbegun projects. I am still learning, but I've been picking up new knowledge almost every day and trying out new stuff since 2020. I'm always down for a new challenge.

- 🌍 The languages I speak: C, Python, Markdown (okay I know)
- 😎 What I do: Fun projects and research to learn new standards and skills
- 😢 What I do not do: Professional coding. Please, I'm just a free time coder... lol.

当然了，也欢迎中文交流取得联系。

Yeah that's it. Check my profile and maybe leave a follow.

Oh wait this is GitHub not YouTube
